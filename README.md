# Virtusa Test
An Android application consuming the [Dog Ceo API]([https://developer.github.com/v3/](https://dog.ceo/api/)) to show list of dog breeds and their image.
I've created this project to showcase these practices - MVVM + Clean Architecture + DI using Dagger Hilt + Unit Testing + Instrumentation Testing + CI/CD with Github Actions.
